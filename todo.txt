send button on contact form put beside 'Message' and same look 
logo images on pages seem to be different colours
change favicon
an about button in the engagement section of services page
on about page be able to go back to services without using navbar
jamie wright/dg have the same pop/mag effect as the services
no mention of area of operation - good for seo 
"we have you covered" somewhere on the main hero page? 
the logo/nav on hero page is covering the back graphic, think of a workaround
remove the aboutgwx area on the main page as its repeating info on the about page, think of filling the gap 
--- overview section can be expanded, a bit low on info. more pictures too?
